            For an artist, art is like the asset of his life that he does not
            want to lose at any cost. Artists are creative, but, at the same
            time, they are sensitive and emotional human beings who can feel
            depressed very easily. Even a little mess can upset them and
            distract them from what they have been doing. For instance, the
            sudden fall off a paint palette which can cause a mess at the
            workplace and spoil the mood of the artist.

            The Fry Public Art Gallery was opened in 1987 and houses an
            impressive number of paintings, prints, illustrations, wallpapers
            and decorative designs by artists of the 20th century and the
            present day who have local connections and have made a significant
            contribution to their field. There is an emphasis on those who for a
            variety of reasons settled in Great Bardfield between the early
            thirties of the last century and the death in 1983 of John Aldridge
            RA who had lived in the village for fifty years.
